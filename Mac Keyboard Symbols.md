# Modifiers #

When a key combination is displayed, the modifiers are written in the order presented here.  For example, <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> would be written as **⌃⌥⇧⌘Q**.

| Sym | Key         | Alt |
|:---:|:------------|:---:|
|  ⌃  | Control     |     |
|  ⌥  | Option      |     |
|  ⇧  | Shift       |     |
|  ⌘  | Command     |    |

There is also a **Fn** modifier on modern Mac keyboards.  Typically this isn't seen in keyboard shortcuts because it's only used to access keys F1 through F20.  However, and can technically be combined with Control plus one other key to get a unique legacy combination.  Each of these Fn + Control combinations maps to a character in Unicodes U+FF700 to U+FF7FF private use range.  Some programs will erroneously print these characters upon receiving such a combination.  [Specification](ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/CORPCHAR.TXT)
