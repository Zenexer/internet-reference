## Modifiers ##

When a key combination is displayed, the modifiers are written in the order presented here.  For example, <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> would be written as **⌃⌥⇧⌘Q**.

| Sym | Key         | Alt |
|:---:|:------------|:---:|
|  ⌃  | Control     |     |
|  ⌥  | Option      |     |
|  ⇧  | Shift       |     |
|  ⌘  | Command     |    |

The Command key was formerly represented by an Apple logo.  The Apple logo is one fo the few symbols here that can be easily typed with a typical keyboard layout: **⌥⇧K**

There is also a **Fn** modifier on modern Mac keyboards.  Typically this isn't seen in keyboard shortcuts because it's only used to access keys F1 through F20.  However, and can technically be combined with Control plus one other key to get a unique legacy combination.  Each of these Fn + Control combinations maps to a character in Unicodes U+F700 to U+F7FF private use range.  Some programs will erroneously print these characters upon receiving such a combination.  With system Mac fonts, these characters lack visible glyphs, and are for internal use only.  ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/CORPCHAR.TXT

The alternate eject symbol is from a Unicode private use region.  Apple designates it for use with mapping to/from the Apple Keyboard encoding.  Ideally, the official Unicode variant should be used instead, as it will be compatible with fonts on other platforms.  ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/CORPCHAR.TXT

The click symbol is private a Unicode private use region and is likely incompatible with other platforms.

Some entries are missing key names; these don't map to physical keys.

LTR indicates usage with left-to-right languages: that means text flows from left to right, such as in most Western languages.  RTL indicates the opposite.  Many keyboards have both Delete Left and Delete Right, regardless of text direction.

ISO indicates a symbol designated by an ISO standard.  ISO standard symbols aren't necessarily used by Mac.

Symbols composed of multiple Unicode characters are special in that they are treated as a single character on Mac, despite appearing as multiple symbols.  For most of the characters, this grouping is controlled by the first character, which is a Unicode private use character that is invisible on Mac.  The others use standard Unicode combining techniques.
